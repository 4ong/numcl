;; dot(a, b[, out]) 	Dot product of two arrays.
;; linalg.multi_dot(arrays) 	Compute the dot product of two or more arrays in a single function call, while automatically selecting the fastest evaluation order.
;; vdot(a, b) 	Return the dot product of two vectors.
;; inner(a, b) 	Inner product of two arrays.
;; outer(a, b[, out]) 	Compute the outer product of two vectors.
;; matmul(a, b[, out]) 	Matrix product of two arrays.
;; tensordot(a, b[, axes]) 	Compute tensor dot product along specified axes for arrays >= 1-D.
;; einsum(subscripts, *operands[, out, dtype, â€¦]) 	Evaluates the Einstein summation convention on the operands.
;; einsum_path(subscripts, *operands[, optimize]) 	Evaluates the lowest cost contraction order for an einsum expression by considering the creation of intermediate arrays.
;; linalg.matrix_power(a, n) 	Raise a square matrix to the (integer) power n.
;; kron(a, b) 	Kronecker product of two arrays.

;; misc functions. These are tentative, base implementations.
;; they will eventually be replaced by BLAS/LAPACK routines.
